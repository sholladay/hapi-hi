# hapi-hi [![Build status for hapi-hi on Circle CI.](https://img.shields.io/circleci/project/sholladay/hapi-hi/master.svg "Circle Build Status")](https://circleci.com/gh/sholladay/hapi-hi "Hapi Hi Builds")

> Status route for your server.

## Why?

 - Provides useful metrics about your server.
 - Response format is friendly to humans and machines.
 - Knowing service health helps you recover from errors.

## Install

```sh
npm install hapi-hi --save
```

## Usage

Get it into your program.

```js
const hi = require('hapi-hi');
```

Register the plugin on your server.

```js
server.register(hi)
    .then(() => {
        return server.start();
    })
    .then(() => {
        console.log(server.info.uri);
    });
```

Performing a `GET` to `/status` will return a JSON response similar to this.

```json
{
    "appName"    : "my-project",
    "appVersion" : "1.0.0",
    "statusCode" : 200,
    "status"     : "OK",
    "time"       : "2016-10-06T13:48:10.586Z",
    "process"    : {
        "uptime"  : 519163.478,
        "title"   : "node /srv/my-project/bin/my-project.js",
        "version" : "6.3.1",
        "pid"     : 23794,
    }
}
```

## API

### option

Type: `object`

Plugin settings.

#### cwd

Type: `string`<br>
Default: `process.cwd()`

Where to begin a [find-up search](https://github.com/sindresorhus/read-pkg-up) for your project's package.json. Used to provide the name and version of your app in the status route response.

#### noConflict

Type: `boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Apply a `/__${appName}` prefix to the status route, where `${appName}` is replaced with the `name` from your package.json. This is useful for reverse proxies to remain transparent (e.g. ensure they don't accidentally block access to a file called `status`).
